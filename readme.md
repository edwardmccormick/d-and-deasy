# D and Deasy

A new, hopefully easy, open source method to character creation in Dungeons and Dragons 5e.

Although I enjoy Dungeons and Dragons, this is mostly an opportunity to flex some of my developer/coding skills. Building a character in DnD 5e was just the kind of task that I was looking for - mathy but not too complicated, labor intensive and easily automated, and with a clear concise beginning and end.

##Things it Does
You can create a character, with either point buy or from rolling an 'array' of attributes, see what skills each class offers, and see what the different modifiers to your skills will be at different levels.

##What it doesn't do yet
- There's no way to build a character with a 'standard array' yet, although you *could* type it into the attribute entry method.
- You can't yet add a backround or a race to your character - rather, you can, but it doesn't 'effect' your build at all yet.
- Attribute increases (earned at different levels for different classes) are not implemented at all. 
- Proficiencies (Language, weapons, armor, tools, instruments) are not implemented at all.
- Multi-class characters are not implemented. 
- HP is not implemented, nor spell casting, nor spells/spell slots. 
- Equipment is not implemented
- no AC calculations yet
- Feats are not implemented.
- The formatting/explanations necessary to guide a user through character creation don't exist
- There isn't any error checking - i.e. if you put 74 in for an attribute, the page will calculate your skills based on it. Nor limits on selecting skills.
- There is no ability to 'roll' with the modifiers in question.
- No ability to login/save your work.
